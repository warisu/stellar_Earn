## Error Handling Checklist

> All items below must be verified before requesting review.

### HTTP Exceptions

- [ ] Appropriate NestJS HTTP exceptions used (`NotFoundException`, `BadRequestException`, `ForbiddenException`, `UnauthorizedException`, `ConflictException`, etc.)
- [ ] No raw `Error` thrown where an HTTP exception is expected
- [ ] Global exception filter handles all unhandled errors gracefully
- [ ] Error responses follow the project's standard error shape

### Input Validation (DTOs)

- [ ] All incoming request bodies and query params have a corresponding DTO
- [ ] DTOs use `class-validator` decorators (`@IsString`, `@IsUUID`, `@IsNotEmpty`, `@IsOptional`, etc.)
- [ ] `class-transformer` decorators applied where necessary (`@Transform`, `@Type`, `@Expose`)
- [ ] `ValidationPipe` is applied globally or at the controller level - raw unvalidated input is never used

### Guards & Authorization

- [ ] Endpoints requiring authentication are protected with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` or equivalent
- [ ] Admin-only endpoints use the appropriate admin guard / role check
- [ ] Public endpoints are explicitly marked with `@Public()` decorator where applicable
- [ ] Throttler guard behaviour verified - rate limits are not unintentionally bypassed

### Logging

- [ ] Significant operations and state transitions are logged using the project's Winston logger (`LoggerService`)
- [ ] Errors are logged at `error` level with stack traces
- [ ] No sensitive data (passwords, secrets, private keys, tokens) is included in log output
- [ ] Incoming request / response logging is handled by the global `LoggerMiddleware` - no duplicate logs added

### Stellar / Soroban Contract Interactions

- [ ] Contract calls wrapped in try/catch with descriptive error messages
- [ ] Horizon / Soroban RPC failures do not crash the service - fallback or retry logic applied where appropriate
- [ ] Transaction signing uses environment-provided keys only - no hardcoded secrets

---

## Database / Migration

- [ ] No database changes - not applicable
- [ ] TypeORM migration created and tested (`npm run typeorm:generate-migration`)
- [ ] Migration is reversible (down migration implemented)
- [ ] Seed data updated if required (`seed.ts`)

## Breaking Type / Model Changes (Frontend — FE-068)

> Required if your PR modifies any file under `FrontEnd/my-app/lib/types/**`,
> `FrontEnd/my-app/lib/api/**`, `FrontEnd/my-app/lib/schemas/**`,
> `FrontEnd/my-app/lib/validation/**`, or `FrontEnd/my-app/context/walletTypes.ts`.

> Full policy: [`FrontEnd/my-app/docs/TYPE_CHANGES_POLICY.md`](../FrontEnd/my-app/docs/TYPE_CHANGES_POLICY.md)

- [ ] My PR touches **none** of the watched type/model paths — not applicable.
- [ ] I classified my change as: ☐ `breaking-types` ☐ `breaking-runtime` ☐ `added` ☐ `changed` ☐ `deprecated` ☐ `removed` ☐ `fixed` ☐ `security`
- [ ] I added a bullet to `## [Unreleased]` in [`FrontEnd/my-app/CHANGELOG.md`](../FrontEnd/my-app/CHANGELOG.md) **OR** a new file in [`FrontEnd/my-app/.changeset/`](../FrontEnd/my-app/.changeset/README.md).
- [ ] If breaking, my entry includes a before/after `Migration:` code block.
- [ ] `cd FrontEnd/my-app && npm run changelog:check` passes locally.
- [ ] If I am asserting this change is non-breaking despite touching a watched file, I added the `changelog-skip` label or `[changelog-skip]` to the PR title.


## Final Pre-Merge Checklist

- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main` / `master`
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Formatting passes (`npm run format`)
- [ ] No `console.log` / debug statements left in production code
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or environment-specific values in source code
- [ ] `.env.example` updated if new environment variables were introduced
- [ ] `ReadMe Backend.md` or `ReadMe Frontend.md` updated if setup steps changed
