# Changelog

All notable changes to the EarnQuest smart contract will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) adapted for contract storage, events, and public interfaces as defined in the [Changelog Discipline Policy](docs/CHANGELOG_DISCIPLINE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added the [Changelog Discipline Policy](docs/CHANGELOG_DISCIPLINE.md) to define how contract-breaking changes, migrations, and version bumps must be documented.
- Added CI validation for contract changelog updates and breaking-change metadata so contract interface changes cannot merge without matching release notes.
- Initialized this changelog so future contract releases have a single source of truth.
