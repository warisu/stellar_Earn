# EarnQuest Contract Roadmap

Linking security, performance, and reliability milestones for the `earn-quest` smart contract on Stellar/Soroban.

---

## Overview

This roadmap tracks planned improvements across three pillars:

- **Security** — protecting funds, authorization, and user data
- **Performance** — reducing resource consumption and transaction costs
- **Reliability** — ensuring correctness, recoverability, and observability

Each milestone references the relevant source modules in `src/`.

---

## Milestone 1 — Security Hardening

**Goal:** Eliminate remaining attack surfaces and strengthen authorization across all entry points.

| Task | Module | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Authorization checks on all state-changing functions | `security.rs`, `admin.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Duplicate claim prevention via status tracking | `payout.rs`, `submission.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Balance validation before every transfer | `escrow.rs`, `payout.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Dispute participant validation | `dispute.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Input bounds checking on all public functions | `validation.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Oracle data freshness checks | `oracle.rs` | 🔄 In Progress |
| Fuzz testing for all entry points | `fuzz/` | 🔄 In Progress |
| Formal audit of `escrow.rs` and `payout.rs` | — | 📋 Planned |

**References:** `src/security.rs`, `src/validation.rs`, `src/admin.rs`

## Milestone 2 — Performance Optimization

**Goal:** Minimize ledger entry reads/writes and WASM binary size to reduce transaction fees.

| Task | Module | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Split-storage model for escrow (hot/cold separation) | `escrow.rs`, `storage.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Unified storage key system to avoid key collisions | `unified_keys.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Indexed event topics for efficient off-chain queries | `events.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Lazy loading of cold escrow metadata | `storage.rs` | 📋 Planned |
| Batch payout processing to reduce per-call overhead | `payout.rs` | 📋 Planned |
| WASM binary size audit and dead-code elimination | — | 📋 Planned |
| Gas benchmarking across all public entry points | `stats.rs` | 📋 Planned |

**References:** `src/storage.rs`, `src/unified_keys.rs`, `src/stats.rs`

---

## Milestone 3 — Reliability & Observability

**Goal:** Ensure the contract behaves correctly under all conditions and failures are visible and recoverable.

| Task | Module | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Comprehensive error types with clear failure reasons | `errors.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Event emission for all state transitions | `events.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Dispute resolution with on-chain state tracking | `dispute.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Appeal process with senior reviewer escalation | `dispute.rs` | ✅ Done |
| Test snapshot system (174 snapshots) | `tests/` | ✅ Done |
| Cross-contract interface tests | `tests/` | ✅ Done |
| Reputation tracking for quest participants | `reputation.rs` | 🔄 In Progress |
| Automated migration validation on contract upgrade | `init.rs` | 📋 Planned |
| On-chain stats dashboard for monitoring | `stats.rs`, `test_stats.rs` | 📋 Planned |

**References:** `src/errors.rs`, `src/events.rs`, `src/dispute.rs`, `src/reputation.rs`

---

## Milestone 4 — Production Readiness

**Goal:** Full testnet and mainnet deployment with integration testing and frontend connectivity.

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Deploy to Stellar testnet | 📋 Planned |
| Integration testing with real Stellar tokens | 📋 Planned |
| Frontend integration with UI | 📋 Planned |
| Indexer setup for claim and dispute events | 📋 Planned |
| Final security audit before mainnet | 📋 Planned |
| Mainnet deployment | 📋 Planned |
